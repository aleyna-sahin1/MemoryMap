## 📍 MemoryMap – Save Your Memories on the Map

MemoryMap is a personal memory journal that lets you connect your memories with the places where they happened. Instead of saving memories as plain notes, you can store them together with photos and locations, creating a meaningful map of your life.
Each memory is pinned to a specific place, allowing you to revisit not only locations but also the emotions and moments you experienced there.
